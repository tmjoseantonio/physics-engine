# physics-engine
A simple Javascript based physics engine attempt.

The objective for this repository is for me to run explorations to understand better the physics involved in 2D games and computed simulations.

## Getting started:
This project was build using Typescript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links

Install project dependencies:
```shell
yarn install
```

Run Typescript:
```shell
yarn run autotsc
```

Run Webpack server
```shell
yarn run build-dev
```

In the browser open the following url: http://0.0.0.0:8080
