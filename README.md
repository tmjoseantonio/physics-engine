The objective for this repository is for me to run explorations to understand better the physics involved in 2D games and computed simulations.

## Getting started:
Install requirements:
```shell
npm i -g yarn watch-http-server
```

Run the server:
```shell
yarn run start
```
In the browser open the following url: http://0.0.0.0:8080
